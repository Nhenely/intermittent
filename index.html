      It is not <em>what</em> you eat, but <em>when</em> you eat that matters

    <h3>What is Intermittent Fasting?</h3>
    <p>
      Intermittent fasting is a trend quickly growing in popularity. Also known
      as intermittent energy restriction, is an umbrella term for various meal
      timing schedules that cycle between voluntary fasting (or reduced calorie
      intake) and non-fasting over a given period. Methods of intermittent
      fasting include alternate-day fasting, periodic fasting, and daily
      time-restricted feeding. A type of periodic fasting known as the 5:2 diet
      was popularised in the UK and Australia by Michael Mosley around 2012.
      Intermittent fasting may have similar effects to a calorie-restriction
      diet, and has been studied in the 21st century as a practice to possibly
      reduce the risk of diet-related diseases, such as metabolic syndrome. A
      2019 review concluded that intermittent fasting may help with obesity,
      insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation.

    <h3>When Do I Eat?</h3>
    <p>
      There are a couple methods for integrating intermittent fasting into your
      daily routine. One of the most popular, and the one we will discuss on
      this site, is following the 16/8 method. The 16/8 method involves daily
      fasts of about 16 hours. Each day youâ€™ll restrict your eating to an
      approximately 8-hour window during which you fit in two, three, or more
      meals. Utilize the <strong>calculate your schedule</strong> button below
      to determine timing that works well for you.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a reminder, while there is growing research supporting the health
      benefits of intermittent fasting, studies are preliminary and there is a
      still a lot to learn about the long-term impacts. Always discuss with your
      doctor before starting a new diet.
